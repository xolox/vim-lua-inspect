Introduction ~

The Vim plug-in 'luainspect.vim' uses the LuaInspect [1] tool to
(automatically) perform semantic highlighting of variables in Lua source code.
It was inspired by lua2-mode [2] (for Emacs [3]) and the SciTE [4] plug-in
included with LuaInspect. In addition to the semantic highlighting the
following features are currently supported:

- Press '<F2>' with the text cursor on a variable and the plug-in will prompt
  you to rename the variable.

- Press 'gd' (in normal mode) with the text cursor on a variable and you'll
  jump to its declaration / first occurrence.

- When you hover over a variable with the mouse cursor in graphical Vim,
  information about the variable is displayed in a tooltip.

- If the text cursor is on a variable while the highlighting is refreshed
  then all occurrences of the variable will be marked in the style of Vim's
  cursorline option (see |'cursorline'|).

- When luainspect reports a wrong argument count for a function call the text
  will be highlighted with a green underline. When you hover over the
  highlighted text a tooltip shows the associated warning message.

- When LuaInspect reports warnings about unused variables, wrong argument
  counts, etc. they are shown in a location list window (see |location-
  list|).

- When a syntax error is found (during highlighting or using the rename
  functionality) the lines where the error is reported will be marked like a
  spelling error.

                                                      *luainspect-installation*
Installation ~

_Please note that the vim-lua-inspect plug-in requires my vim-misc plug-in
which is separately distributed._

Unzip the most recent ZIP archives of the vim-lua-inspect [6] and vim-misc [7]
plug-ins inside your Vim profile directory (usually this is '~/.vim' on UNIX
and '%USERPROFILE%\vimfiles' on Windows), restart Vim and execute the command
':helptags ~/.vim/doc' (use ':helptags ~\vimfiles\doc' instead on Windows).

If you prefer you can also use Pathogen [8], Vundle [9] or a similar tool to
install & update the vim-lua-inspect [10] and vim-misc [11] plug-ins using a
local clone of the git repository.

Now try it out: Edit a Lua file and within a few seconds semantic highlighting
should be enabled automatically!

Note that on Windows a command prompt window pops up whenever LuaInspect is run
as an external process. If this bothers you then you can install my shell.vim
[12] plug-in which includes a DLL [13] that works around this issue. Once
you've installed both plug-ins it should work out of the box!

===============================================================================
                                                             *luainspect-usage*
Usage ~

When you open any Lua file the semantic highlighting should be enabled
automatically within a few seconds, so you don't have to configure anything if
you're happy with the defaults.

===============================================================================
                                                          *luainspect-commands*
Commands ~

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The *:LuaInspect* command

You don't need to use this command unless you've disabled automatic
highlighting using |g:lua_inspect_events|. When you execute this command the
plug-in runs the LuaInspect tool and then highlights all variables in the
current buffer using one of the following highlighting groups:

- luaInspectGlobalDefined
- luaInspectGlobalUndefined
- luaInspectLocalUnused
- luaInspectLocalMutated
- luaInspectUpValue
- luaInspectParam
- luaInspectLocal
- luaInspectFieldDefined
- luaInspectFieldUndefined
- luaInspectSelectedVariable
- luaInspectWrongArgCount
- luaInspectSyntaxError

If you don't like one or more of the default styles the Vim documentation
describes how to change them (see |:hi-default|). If you want to disable the
semantic highlighting in a specific Vim buffer execute ':LuaInspect!' in that
buffer. When you want to re-enable the highlighting execute |:LuaInspect|
again, but now without the bang (!) (see |:command-bang|).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The *:LuaInspectToggle* command

By default the semantic highlighting and the warning messages in the location
list window are automatically applied to Lua buffers and updated every once in
a while, but this can be disabled by setting |g:lua_inspect_events| to an empty
string in your |vimrc| script. If the plug-in is not automatically enabled then
it may be useful to enable/disable it using a key mapping. That's what the
|:LuaInspectToggle| command is for. You still have to define your key mapping
of choice in your |vimrc| script though. For example:
>
  " Don't enable the lua-inspect plug-in automatically in Lua buffers.
  let g:lua_inspect_events = ''
  
  " Enable/disable the lua-inspect plug-in manually using <F6>.
  imap <F6> <C-o>:LuaInspectToggle<CR>
  nmap <F6>      :LuaInspectToggle<CR>
<
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The *:LuaInspectRename* command

This command renames the variable under the cursor. It's used to define the
'<F2>' mapping and can be used if you don't like the default mappings and want
to define your own.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The *:LuaInspectGoTo* command

This command jumps to the definition of the variable under the cursor. It's
used to define the 'gd' mapping and can be used if you don't like the default
mappings and want to define your own.

===============================================================================
                                                           *luainspect-options*
Options ~

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The *g:loaded_luainspect* option

This variable isn't really an option but if you want to avoid loading the
'luainspect.vim' plug-in you can set this variable to any value in your |vimrc|
script:
>
  :let g:loaded_luainspect = 1
<
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The *g:lua_inspect_mappings* option

If this is set to true (1, the default value) then the '<F2>' and 'gd' mappings
are defined in Lua buffers (as buffer local mappings). You can set it to false
(0) to disable the default mappings (so you can define your own).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The *g:lua_inspect_warnings* option

When LuaInspect reports warnings about unused variables, wrong argument counts,
etc. they are automatically shown in a location list window (see |location-
list|). If you don't like this add the following to your |vimrc| script:
>
  :let g:lua_inspect_warnings = 0
<
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The *g:lua_inspect_events* option

By default semantic highlighting is automatically enabled after a short timeout
and when you save a buffer. If you want to disable automatic highlighting
altogether add the following to your |vimrc| script:
>
  :let g:lua_inspect_events = ''
<
You can also add events, for example if you also want to run |:LuaInspect| the
moment you edit a Lua file then try this:
>
  :let g:lua_inspect_events = 'CursorHold,CursorHoldI,BufReadPost,BufWritePost'
<
Note that this only works when the plug-in is loaded (or reloaded) _after_
setting the |g:lua_inspect_events| option.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The *g:lua_inspect_internal* option

The plug-in uses the Lua interface for Vim when available so that it doesn't
have to run LuaInspect as an external program (which can slow things down). If
you insist on running LuaInspect as an external program you can set this
variable to false (0) in your |vimrc| script:
>
  :let g:lua_inspect_internal = 0
<
